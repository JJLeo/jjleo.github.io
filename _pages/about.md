I am a third-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Xin Zhang](https://xinpl.github.io) at [Programming Languages Lab](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.pku.edu.cn), [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). My research focuses on leveraging intelligent approaches, including Bayesian models and large language models, to enhance static analysis and software testing.

## Education

1. 2019-09-03 to 2023-06-17, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn), B.E. in Computer Science and Technology.
2. 2023-09-04 to present, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn), Ph.D. in Computer Software and Theory.

I am now a first-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Xin Zhang](https://xinpl.github.io) at [Programming Languages Lab](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.pku.edu.cn), [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). I am now interested in the combination of conventional program analysis and probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian network).
